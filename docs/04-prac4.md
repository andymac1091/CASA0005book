## Introduction 

In this practical session, you will learn how to produce work that is open, reproducible and portable using RStudio, RMarkdown, Git and Github. You will be able to use the information contained in this guide to prepare the submission for Part 1 of the assessment for this course. The tools you will use are:

RStudio is a graphical user interface (that you should already be familiar with) - it contains a number of features which make it excellent for authoring reproducible and open geographic data science work.

RMarkdown is a version of the Markdown markup language which enables plain text to be formatted to contain links to data, code to run, text to explain what you a producing and metadata to tell your software what kinds of outputs to generate from your markdown code. For more information on RMarkdown, visit here.

Git is a software version control system which allows you to keep track of the code you produce and the changes that you or others make to it.

GitHub is an online repository that allows anyone to view the code you have produced (in whatever language you choose to program in) and use/scrutinise/contribute to/comment on it.
